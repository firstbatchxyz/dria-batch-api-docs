title: Welcome to Dria
---

## Platform overview

Dria is a crowdsourced AI network that bundles high-throughput inference and automated prompt evolution behind one API surface. Builders get a single, OpenAPI-defined contract for both the Batch Inference product and the GEPA Prompt Evolution service.

## One OpenAPI spec for everything

Mintlify’s API playground reads directly from the Dria spec at <https://mainnet.dkn.dria.co/api/v0/doc>. It is an OpenAPI 3.0 document with the proper `servers` entry and the `ApiKeyAuth` security scheme (`x-api-key` header), so you can drop the URL into `mint.json` without any preprocessing.

| Namespace | Base path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Batch jobs | `/batch/*` | Create, list, and inspect inference jobs. |
| GEPA | `/gepa/*` | Start and monitor prompt evolution executions. |
| File helper | `/file/*` | Generate pre-signed URLs for `.jsonl` uploads. |

All read/write traffic shares the same server: `https://mainnet.dkn.dria.co/api/v0`. POST operations require the `x-api-key` header; Mintlify will surface the field automatically when the spec is linked.

## Product highlights

### Batch Inference

The [Batch guide](batch) explains how to structure `.jsonl` payloads, upload them through `/file/get_upload_url`, and finalize the job with `/batch/complete_upload`. Use it whenever you need the cheapest, highest-throughput way to score tens of thousands of prompts asynchronously.

### GEPA Prompt Evolution

The [GEPA guide](gepa) covers the `/gepa/start_execution` flow, polling endpoints, and how to interpret prompt evolution histories. Use GEPA to iterate toward the best-performing instructions without touching the underlying model weights.

### Combined workflow

GEPA can tune prompts that later run at scale via Batch jobs. Because the spec is unified, you can reuse the same SDK or Mintlify-generated API Playground to move between both workflows.

## Using the OpenAPI spec in Mintlify

1. In `mint.json`, add an `openapi` field (e.g., on an “API Reference” group) that points to `https://mainnet.dkn.dria.co/api/v0/doc`.
2. Reference endpoints directly in navigation entries such as `POST /batch/complete_upload` or `POST /gepa/start_execution` to generate live API pages.
3. Use MDX frontmatter (`openapi: "POST /batch/complete_upload"`) when you need to add narrative context alongside the generated parameters/responses.
4. Customize operation titles or descriptions with the `x-mint.metadata` extension inside the OpenAPI file if you need more human-friendly names.

Following [Mintlify’s OpenAPI setup guide](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup) ensures the playground stays in sync with the Dria backend as new endpoints ship.

## Quick start

1. Create or retrieve an API key from the Dria dashboard.
2. Decide whether you are running a batch job or a GEPA evolution.
3. Point your client (or Mintlify API Playground) at `https://mainnet.dkn.dria.co/api/v0`.
4. Use the spec to copy the exact request bodies, required headers, and response schemas.
5. Dive into the product-specific guides linked above for step-by-step walkthroughs.

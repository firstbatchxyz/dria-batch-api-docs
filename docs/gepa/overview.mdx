- **Automatic prompt improvement** through reflective learning
- **Sample-efficient optimization** (up to 35x fewer iterations than traditional methods)
- **Transparent evolution history** with scores and ancestry tracking
- **No fine-tuning required** - works with existing models
- **High performance** - achieves 0.99+ scores on pedagogical tasks

**Ideal for:**

- Optimizing support response templates
- Refining instruction prompts
- Improving task-specific outputs
- Evolving domain-aware technical documentation
- Security code review templates

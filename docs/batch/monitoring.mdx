### 3. Monitor and Retrieve Results

After the upload has been completed, your batch job will be processed asynchronously. Immediately following this you may:

- Use the [web interface](https://dria.co/batch-inference) to upload, check of, and download any subsequent results.

## Example Output File

Each line in the output `.jsonl` file corresponds to a request, including the model, result, and token usage.

Example:

```jsonl
{"model": "gemma3:12b", "result": "...response text...", "token_count": 2333}
{"model": "gemma3:12b", "result": "...response text...", "token_count": 2319}
```

- Use `custom_id` to match input and output lines.
- Failed requests will include error information.
